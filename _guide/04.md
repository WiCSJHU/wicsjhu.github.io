title: About ACM
---

Membership in WiCS automatically grants you membership in the
Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), the other undergraduate CS
organization on campus.

Note: ACM is a more "general CS" group (less discussion of interview tips,
workplace environments, etc. and more speakers, including our CS faculty,
who talk about specialized fields).

WiCS and ACM collaborate on a ton of events, including:

- joint workshops and/or tech talks
- special celebrations, like Ada Lovelace's birthday party and Pi Day
- fun hangouts, like *Game of Thrones* viewing parties

To stay up-to-date, check out our [Events](events) resources.
And feel free to ask our WiCS boards about ACM!
