Everyone is welcome to join our group/mailing list and attend our general
events, but members get:

- membership status (if you like bragging rights), plus their name on our website
- access to our database of resources (for internships, scholarships, etc.)
- access to the ACM lounge (Malone Hall, G67)

**Active** members additionally get:

- invites to exclusive company events
- our spring mentorship program (you must be an active member in the preceding fall)

To become a member of WiCS, come to three of our events.
During/after your third event, let the chair or vice chair know and one of them
will add you to our site and give database/lounge access.

To remain an **active** member, come to at least two events each semester.
(Remind the chair or vice chair during/after your second event to make sure
your name is on the active members list for the current semester!)
