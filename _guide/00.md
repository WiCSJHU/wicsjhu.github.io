Women in CS (WiCS) is for women/non-binary indiduals,
as well as other underrepresented groups in tech (and allies!),
who are involved in CSâ€”whether it's major, minoring, or seriously considering
majoring/minoring.

We focus on:

- forming friendships
- helping you find internships and jobs
- providing a welcoming place to both work *and* hang out (and eat!)

Our events often include:

- company tech talks/workshops
- movie nights
- dinners with WiCS alumni
- breakfast study sessions
- student-led workshops/talks

and always include:

- *Coding Circle*, a weekly meeting (Friday, Malone 107, 4:30pm)
with snacks, nail polish, and playing cards.
We'll discuss the Topic of the Week
("internship hunting," "group project tips")
and also just hang out and unwind
- Our *mentorship program*, where we pair underclassmen and upperclassmen
based on their interests. Mentors get to share their experiences and offer
advice; mentees get to ask questions and receive helpful tips; and everyone
gets to meet new people and participate in fun bonding events.
Sign-ups are in the winter/spring and for *active* members only!
